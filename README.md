# LeetCode JS Solutions

Welcome to my **LeetCode-JS-Solutions** repository! 🚀

This repository contains my solutions to various LeetCode challenges, solved mostly using **JavaScript**. My goal is to continuously improve my problem-solving skills and share these solutions to help others in their coding journey.

## 📁 Structure

The repository is organized by difficulty levels and topic categories:
```
├── Easy  
│   ├── two_sum.js  
│   └── palindrome_number.js  
├── Medium  
│   ├── add_two_numbers.js  
│   └── longest_substring.js  
├── Hard  
│   ├── sliding_window_maximum.js  
│   └── median_of_two_sorted_arrays.js  
└── README.md
```
- **Easy**: Basic problems to warm up.
- **Medium**: Intermediate challenges that require more thought.
- **Hard**: Advanced problems that push problem-solving to the limit.

## 🧠 Problem-Solving Approach

For each solution, I aim to:

1. Understand the problem statement.
2. Identify the optimal algorithm and data structures.
3. Write clean, readable, and efficient code.
4. Add comments to explain key logic or tricky parts of the code.

## 🚩 How to Use

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash 
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/LeetCode-JS-Solutions.git
2.	Navigate to the folder of interest (e.g., Easy, Medium, Hard).
3.	Open the JavaScript file in your editor and review the solution.
4.	Run the file in your local environment to test the solution.
