// Given an array of intervals intervals where intervals[i] = [starti, endi], return the minimum number of intervals you need to remove to make the rest of the intervals non-overlapping.
// Note that intervals which only touch at a point are non-overlapping. For example, [1, 2] and [2, 3] are non-overlapping.

// Example 1:
// Input: intervals = [[1,2],[2,3],[3,4],[1,3]]
// Output: 1
// Explanation: [1,3] can be removed and the rest of the intervals are non-overlapping.

// Example 2:
// Input: intervals = [[1,2],[1,2],[1,2]]
// Output: 2
// Explanation: You need to remove two [1,2] to make the rest of the intervals non-overlapping.

// Example 3:
// Input: intervals = [[1,2],[2,3]]
// Output: 0
// Explanation: You don't need to remove any of the intervals since they're already non-overlapping.

// Constraints:
// 1 <= intervals.length <= 105
// intervals[i].length == 2
// -5 * 104 <= starti < endi <= 5 * 104
